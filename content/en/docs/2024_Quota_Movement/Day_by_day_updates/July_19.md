Despite the curfew, general people amass around Muhammadpur, Rampura, Sonir Akhra, Banasree, etc. Police are ordered to open fire of civilians and many die on the spot. Around noon, helicopters are seen hovering over areas with gatherings as they drop sound grenades. [[Some report to have shot on civilians and even playing fields with children.]] [[Requires verification]]. The government tries to divert the narrative by implying that miscreants have taken to the streets to create chaos.
