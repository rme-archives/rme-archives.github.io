BCL is the pro-government student wing, which is, effectively, the governmentâ€™s vigilante force. they are the ones who keep the student body in check and are the party cadre called upon when there is any sign of rebellion. It is a vigilante group that can kill, kidnap or disappear at party command. For a government that lacks legitimacy, these are the foot soldiers who terrorise and are essential parts of the coercive machinery. - from [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/7/23/bangladesh-protests-are-no-longer-about-the-quota-system).
